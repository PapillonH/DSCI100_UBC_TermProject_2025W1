##  Project Overview
This repository contains the **individual planning stage** of the UBC DSCI 100 Term Project.  
The goal of this stage is to demonstrate understanding of the dataset, formulate a predictive question, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and plan appropriate modelling methods.

The project uses real gameplay data from the [UBC PLAI Research Group](https://plai.cs.ubc.ca/) collected through the **PLAICraft Minecraft server**.  
The analysis will be conducted in **R using Jupyter Notebook**.

##  Dataset Description
Two datasets are provided:

| File | Description |
|------|--------------|
| `players.csv` | Contains data for each unique player (e.g., demographics, in-game actions, subscription info). |
| `sessions.csv` | Contains data for each individual play session, such as duration, time, and activity metrics. |

##  Project Objectives
The goal is to explore the dataset and answer **one of the following broad research questions**:

1. What player characteristics and behaviours are most predictive of subscribing to a game-related newsletter?  
2. Which kinds of players are most likely to contribute a large amount of data?  
3. What time windows are most likely to have large numbers of simultaneous players (demand forecasting)?

For this individual stage, I will:
- Select **one** of the questions above and formulate a specific predictive question.
- Perform **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** using `players.csv` and `sessions.csv`.
- Propose a **methodological plan** (without modelling yet).
